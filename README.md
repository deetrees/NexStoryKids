NexStory: AI-Powered Personalized Storybook GeneratorNexStory is a sophisticated, multi-agent AI system designed to create unique, personalized, and illustrated children's storybooks on demand. By leveraging a crew of specialized AI agents, each powered by a best-in-class language model, NexStory transforms a simple user prompt into a complete, ready-to-read digital storybook.This project serves as a powerful prototype for a full-fledged web application, complete with a backend server running on the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), ready for frontend integration and future expansion with e-commerce and print-on-demand capabilities.‚ú® FeaturesMulti-Agent Workflow: A team of five specialized AI agents (Interviewer, Creator, Illustrator, Compliance Officer, and Assembler) collaborate in a sequential workflow to produce the final story.Strategic Multi-Model Backend: Utilizes the best AI model for each specific task:GPT-4o for robust user interaction and compliance checks.Claude 3 Opus for high-quality, creative story writing.Gemini 2.5 Flash for creative reasoning and prompt generation.Custom Tool Integration: Features custom-built tools that allow agents to perform specialized tasks, such as calling the Replicate API to generate high-quality illustrations using the flux-kontext-max model.Built-in Safety and Compliance: Includes a dedicated agent to review all generated content for child safety, privacy (COPPA), and age-appropriateness.ACP-Compliant Server: The entire crewAI workflow is wrapped in a server that speaks the Agent Communication Protocol, making it ready for integration with other AI systems or a web-based frontend.Secure Configuration: All API keys and sensitive credentials are managed securely using a .env file.üíª Technology StackOrchestration: CrewAIServer Protocol: Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)Package Management: uvLanguage Models: OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, Google Gemini 2.5 FlashImage Generation: Replicate (using flux-kontext-max)Cloud Services: AWS Rekognition (for face detection tool)Primary Language: PythonüöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to set up and run the NexStory server on your local machine.1. PrerequisitesPython 3.11+uv installed (pip install uv)API keys for:OpenAIAnthropicGoogle AI StudioReplicateAmazon Web Services (AWS)2. InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexstory-final.git
cd nexstory-final
Initialize the uv environment:uv init
Activate the virtual environment:source .venv/bin/activate
Create and configure your .env file:Create a file named .env in the root of the project.Add your secret API keys to this file. Do not use quotes.# .env file

Install all dependencies:uv will read the pyproject.toml file and install everything needed.uv sync
3. Running the ApplicationThe project runs as a client-server application. You will need two terminal windows.In Terminal 1 - Start the Server:Make sure your virtual environment is activated (source .venv/bin/activate) and run:python crew_agent_server.py
You should see a message indicating that the NexStory ACP Server is running on http://localhost:8000.In Terminal 2 - Run the Client:In a new terminal window, activate the virtual environment (source .venv/bin/activate) and run:python client.py
The client will prompt you for a story idea. Enter your request, and you will see the real-time output from the agent crew as it works to create your story.üó∫Ô∏è Future RoadmapFrontend Integration: Connect the server to the nexstorykids.com landing page to create a full-stack web application.Stripe Integration: Implement a payment gateway to monetize the storybook creation service.Print-on-Demand: Integrate with a service like Lulu to allow users to order physical copies of their personalized books.User Accounts: Build a system for users to save, edit, and manage their created stories.
